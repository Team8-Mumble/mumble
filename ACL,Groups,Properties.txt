A voice chat utility for gamers.

=========================================

Access Control Lists (ACLs), Groups, and Properties in Mumble allow users to edit the settings in any channel and provide allow/deny permissions.
In order to do so, the user must log into Mumble using the SuperUser Account.

=========================================

To start, connect to your server and create Root Channel.
By right-clicking on Root Channel, a drop-down of options will appear.
After clicking 'edit,' a new dialog will display 3 tabs on Properties, Groups and ACL.

=========================================

ACLs are linked to specific channels.
It can inherit the ACL from the parent channel.
When connected to the server, it will show all the entries under the Root Channel.
For each entry, the permission is either allowed or denied.
Initially, only the SuperUser is allowed to edit.
Each entry can be checked off to apply in the current channel(only), sub-channel(only) or both.

=========================================

=========================================

Groups are tied to a specific channel.
Groups can inherit future groups or be inherited by another existing group. This is so ACL permissions on the parent group also edit the permissions on the inherited groups.
Members represent the list of players to add to the group.
Inherit represents the list of members inherited from the same group in the Root Channel.
Exclude represents the list of inherited members to remove from the group.
By using this section, the user can easily manage members in any channel.

=========================================

Properties are only associated to a specific channel.
In this section, the user can edit the name of the channel,
write description about the channel, set password to the channel, and give position on the channel.
