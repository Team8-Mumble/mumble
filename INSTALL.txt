Voice Over Internet Protocol

http://mumble.info/

A voicechat utility for gamers

Linux has own client package name 'mumble' and the server package name is 'mumble-server' or 'murmur'
Mumble should be available in either third party repositories or the official repository.

=====================================

sudo apt-get install mumble (installing client only)

sudo apt-get install mumble-server (installing while configuring the server)

sudo dpkg-reconfigure mumbler-server (if you want to create SuperUser account)

=====================================

Linux carries current version or latest version released at the time. Do not worry about updating the source
everytime when installing.

To start, open terminal or press ctrl+alt+T

In the terminal, copy and paste following line:

=====================================

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mumble/release

sudo apt-get update (update to the current client of linux)

=====================================

In order for mumble or murmur to run, it needs libraries and dependencies installed.

In addition, to manage in interface, code, project, and etc, we need to install qtcreater.

It is a cross-platform coding base tools which used in field of engineering.

It features interface, coding, building, testing, and etc.

=====================================

It is recommended to download development package separately due to compile error.

It may occur while installing at the same time.

=====================================

sudo apt-get install qtcreator (install qtcreator)

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev

sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libasound2-dev libssl-dev

sudo apt-get install libspeechd-dev libzeroc-ice-dev libpulse-dev

sudo apt-get install libcap-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

sudo apt-get install libogg-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libsndfile1-dev

sudo apt-get install libg15daemon-client-dev libxi-dev

=====================================

To continue, we need to download Mumble Source from open source page github.

To compile and build from the source, we will git clone from existing repository.

We will create a folder for this clone in our directory.

Else, if not comfortable, download latest zip from mumble's homepage.

=====================================

sudo apt-get install git (downloading git program which a version for control system designed to handle everything)

git clone <inside, go to open source github and click green button that says clone or download then copy the URL here> mumble

cd mumble

git submodule init

git submodule update

git pull

====================================

After downloading the source, it is time to unzip the package.

unzip mumble-master.zip -d mumble

====================================
