Mumble is a voicechat program for gamers written on top of Qt and Opus.

There are two modules in Mumble; the client (mumble) and the server
(murmur). The client works on Win32/64, Linux and Mac OS X, while the
server should work on anything Qt can be installed on.

Note that when we say Win32, we mean Windows XP or newer.

Running Mumble
==============

On Windows, after installation, you should have a new Mumble folder in your
Start Menu, from which you can start Mumble.

On Mac OS X, to install Mumble, drag the application from the downloaded
disk image into your /Applications folder.

Once Mumble is launched, you need a server to connect to. Either create your
own or join a friend's.

Running Murmur on Unix-like systems
===================================

Murmur should be run from the command line, so start a shell (command prompt)
and go to wherever you installed Mumble. Run murmur as

murmurd [-supw <password>] [-ini <inifile>] [-fg] [v]

-supw   Set new password for the user SuperUser, which is hardcoded to
        bypass ACLs. Keep this password safe. Until you set a password,
        the SuperUser is disabled. If you use this option, murmur will
        set the password in the database and then exit.

-ini    Use a inifile other than murmur.ini, use this to run several instances
        of murmur from the same directory. Make sure each instance is using
        a separate database.

-fg     Run in the foreground, logging to standard output.

-v      More verbose logging.

Running Murmur on Mac OS X
==========================

Murmur is distributed seperately from the Mumble client on Mac OS X.
It is called Static OS X Server and can be downloaded from the main webpage.

Once downloaded it can be run in the same way as on any other Unix-like system.
For more information please see the 'Running Murmur on Unix-like systems' above.

Running Murmur on Win32
=======================

Doubleclick the Murmur icon to start murmur. There will be a small icon on your
taskbar from which you can view the log.

To set the superuser password, run murmur with the parameters '-supw <password>'.

Bandwidth usage
===============

Mumble uses between 8 and 144 Kbps when transmitting speech.  This is partly dependent on the compression scheme chosen (Settings > Audio Input > Compression).  The default setting results in a bandwidth requirement of 54.8 Kbps / stream.
 
The Mumble client will need your configured bandwidth outgoing, and an
appropriate amount incoming based on the number of users talking and the
compression settings.
 
The Mumble server (Murmur) will need a certain amount of incoming
bandwidth to handle all the streams from each client speaking, as
well as enough outgoing bandwidth to transmit those streams to the
other users in the channel.
 
Moreover, since Mumble is geared towards social gaming, the bit rates will be higher like above, because people will be talking continuously and also at the same time, rather than speaking short phrases or commands depending on quality settings.
 
To be more specific, if there are 10 users in a channel, your incoming bandwidth requirement will be (10 * 144 Kbps  = 1440 Kbps).  For the outgoing bandwidth, the maximum requirement in your server will be (144 Kbps * 9 users * 10 streams = 12960 Kbps).
